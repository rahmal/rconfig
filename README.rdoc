= RConfig 

The complete solution for Ruby Configuration Management. RConfig is a Ruby library that manages configuration within Ruby applications. It bridges the gap between yaml, xml, and key/value based properties files, by providing a centralized solution to handle application configuration from one location. It provides the simplicity of hash-based access, that Rubyists have come to know and love, supporting your configuration style of choice, while providing many new features, and an elegant API.

== Features

* Simple, easy to install and use.
* Supports yaml, xml, and properties files.
* Yaml and xml files support infinite level of configuration grouping.
* Properties files support git config-like configuration grouping.
* Intuitive dot-notation 'key chaining' argument access.
* Simple well-known hash/array based argument access.
* Implements multilevel caching to reduce disk access.
* Short-hand access to 'global' application configuration, and shell environment.
* Cascades multiple configuration files to support environment and host-specific configuration.
* On-load callbacks for single, multiple, or any config file.
* Embedded ruby code with ERB templating.
* Support for referencing values in property files (Yaml also has built in support using node anchors).


== Getting Started
=== Rails Apps
RConfig is released as a Ruby Gem. The gem is to be installed within a Ruby on Rails 3 application. To install, simply add the following to your Gemfile:

    # Gemfile
    gem 'rconfig'

After updating your bundle, run the installer

    $> rails generate rconfig:install

The installer creates an initializer used for configuring defaults used by RConfig

=== Non-Rails Apps
If you're not using RConfig in a Rails app, and you don't use Gemfile you can install RConfig with RubyGems

    gem install rconfig


== Requirements
Starting with version 0.4.0, RConfig requires at least Ruby 1.9, and Rails 3. Previous versions can be used in Ruby 1.8 and Rails 2.2+. Non-rails projects need ActiveSupport (>= 3 for RConfig 0.4.0, and > 2.2 for RConfig 0.3).

* Ruby 1.9+
* ActiveSupport 3.0+


== Example

  shell/console =>
    export LANG=en

  demo.yml =>
   server:
     address: host.domain.com
     port: 81
     host: <%= %x{host_name} %>
   ...

  application.properties =>
    debug_level=verbose
    app_root=/home/rahmal/apps/rconfig
    test_root=%{app_root}/tests
  ...

 demo.rb => 
  require 'rconfig'
  RConfig.load_paths = ['$HOME/config', '#{APP_ROOT}/config', '/demo/conf']
  RConfig.demo[:server][:port] => 81
  RConfig.demo.server.address  => 'host.domain.com'
  RConfig.demo.server.host     => 'host.local'

  RConfig.application.test_root => '/home/rahmal/apps/rconfig/tests'

  RConfig[:debug_level] => 'verbose'
  RConfig[:lang] => 'en'
  ...
